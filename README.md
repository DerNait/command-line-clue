### Investigation Conclusion: 

# Murderer:
After a tough search, I conclude that the murder took place at the offices/records and the murderer was The Librarian, as I was able to found The Journalist and The Gardener at different rooms. 

# Weapon: 
After visiting every room posible, I only found objects that were not part of the possible weapons list, like the Brass Candlestick Object.

So in conclusion, the murderer was The Librarian at the offices/records, weapon is still missing.
